# 🛡️ SOC Microsoft Defender Integration Enhancement for Cortex XSIAM (*** In Beta ***)

This repository delivers enhanced integration for Microsoft Defender within Cortex XSIAM. It includes layouts, correlation rules, mappers, and data model updates to support deep visibility and automated response to Windows-based threats.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This pack enables SOC teams to leverage Defender for Endpoint telemetry in Cortex XSIAM by:

- 🖥️ Aggregating endpoint alerts, indicators, and actions in one place.
- 🧠 Enabling enriched detection and alert correlation across the SOC toolset.
- 🔄 Automating response workflows for common Windows threats.
- 📈 Supporting detection of ransomware, persistence, and post-exploitation behavior.

## 📦 What's Included

| Component        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Layouts**       | Analyst-focused dashboards showing Defender alerts, evidence, and response history. |
| **Correlation Rules** | Patterns identifying malware behavior, credential theft, and suspicious process chains. |
| **Automation Scripts** |  
| `displayDefenderEvidence_xsiam` | Displays raw alert record cleanly in layout tab/dynamic sections. |
| `displayDefenderHostRecord_xsiam` | Renders full host record in layout tab/dynamic sections. |
| `displayDefenderHostStatus_xsiam` | Shows host status in a structured format inside layout sections. |

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Configure **two Microsoft integrations**:
  - **O365 Data Source**
    - Ensure **alert fetch** is enabled via **Microsoft Graph Alerts v2**
  - **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** (from Marketplace)
    - Used for **automation commands only**

## 🧠 Analyst Benefits

- Centralized Defender telemetry in XSIAM for faster triage.
- Fewer context switches with integrated enrichment and automation.
- Improved detection accuracy via cross-source correlation.
- Streamlined playbook-driven containment and investigation.

> 🔄 **Compatible with the [SOC Optimization Framework](https://github.com/Palo-Cortex/soc-optimization-framework)** to drive repeatable and measurable SOC operations.
